# React Updating State

## Objectives

1. Explain how to update state in React
2. Explain the difference between changing state and changing props
3. Describe what happens when state or props is updated

## Overview

This is where we dive in to `setState()` and that whole shebang. We can also
introduce students to what happens when props change on an inner component.

I think we can continue to use some idea of a `Toggler` whose state is updated:
that way we can just trigger an on/off switch and pass the result to the child
components as a prop. (It's possible that I'm not seeing something gross about
that implementation, since I'm just spitballing -- feel free to change it.)

This is also the right time to start introducing students to forms and events.
Definitely want to make use of a controlled component or two (which'll require
state.)
